A short video walking you through the options available to you on the Account Settings Page.

This video includes how to change your username, personal details and password, as well as
how to alter your notification settings and which habits you are choosing to track in the
application.

The Account Settings page is also the location that provides you with access to additional
resources to help you with the rehabilitation process, and a means with getting in contact with
us with any queries or concerns you might have.
