## Create Account or Login

## Chat Functionality

One goal of the eGuardian angel system as a whole is to emphasise the important role social connection plays in physical and mental health. The eGuardian angel app will allow you to communicate with both your 'child' and your 'angel' in the network.

## Supporting Your Child's Progress

As an angel, it is your job to support your child's progress. You can do this not only by sending them messages but also by
reacting to their logs, encouraging them by recognising the progress they are making with improving their habits.

## Track Your Progress

The eGuardian angel app also allows you to track your process quantitatively through metrics such as exercise, diet, medication, smoking and your mood.
